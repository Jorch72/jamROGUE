# jamROGUE
My entry for CCJam 2016. It is a multiplayer roguelike.

# IMPORTANT
**This probably won't run in-game (especially on a multiplayer server!!!) so don't try it**

## Client
Client is super cool and not poopy but the code is poopy

## Server
Written in Node.js with ES2015 using Babel. Database is MongoDB, webserver is Express.
